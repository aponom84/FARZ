{"name":"FARZ","tagline":"Benchmark Generator for Community Detection Validation","body":"### Welcome to the FARZ webpage.\r\nFARZ is generator/simulator for networks with built-in community structure. \r\nIt creates graphs/networks with community labels, which can be used for evaluating community detection algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Generator Parameters\r\n* main parameter\r\n   + `n`: number of nodes\r\n   + `k`: number of communities\r\n   + `m`: half the average degree of nodes\r\n* control parameters\r\n   + `beta`: the strength of community structure, i.e. the probability of edges to be formed within communities, default (0.8)\r\n   + `alpha`: the strength of common neighbor's effect on edge formation edges, default (0.5)\r\n   + `gamma`: the strength of degree similarity effect on edge formation, default (0.5), can be negative for networks with negative degree correlation\r\n* config parameters\r\n   + `phi`: the constant added to all community sizes, higher number makes the communities more balanced in size, default (1) which results in power law distribution for community sizes\r\n   + `o`: the number of communities each node can belong to, default (1) \r\n   + `epsilon`: the probability of noisy/random edges, default (0.0000001)\r\n   + `b`: the probability of also connecting to the neighbors of a node each nodes connects to. The default value is (0), but could be increase to a small number to achieve higher clustering coefficient. \r\n \r\n### How to run\r\nThe source code is in Pyhton 2.7. \r\nYou can generate FARZ benchmarks from FARZ.py. See below for examples.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n`params = {\"n\":1000, \"k\":4, \"m\":4, \"alpha\":0.5, \"beta\":0.8, \"gamma\":0.5}`\r\n\r\n* Use FARZ directly\r\n   + `FARZ.realize(**params)`\r\n* Use batch generator\r\n   + Generate a dataset of networks with `beta` varying from 0.5 to 1 with 0.05 steps, for each beta generate 10 networks, and write the networks in gml format.\r\n\r\n    `generate('beta', arange=(0.5,1,0.05), repeat =10, path='./vbeta', format = 'gml', params=params)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reference \r\n[Paper on Arxiv]()\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nReihaneh Rabbany (@rabbanyk), rabbanyk@ualberta.ca","google":"UA-31924586-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
